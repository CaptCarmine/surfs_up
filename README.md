## Overview

We are following up on the trends for Oahu's weather for our client. We are looking to compare the weather between June and December, to see how drastic the difference is between Summer and Winter weather.

## Results

1. The images below show the average weather of Oahu, in June and December.
2. June has an average weather of 74.9 degrees, which is a great temperature for a Surf/ Ice cream shop, and even better the average temperature in December is only 3 degrees lower.
3. Following the other data points you can see that even at the 25% the temperature only deviates about 2 degrees away from the mean, not even 1 full standard deviation away.
4. December does have a much lower minimum temperature, but that does not have a large on any other metric.

## Summary

Based on the temperatures, I would say that building a surf shop on Oahu is a great Idea. I would say though that the information is not complete though, and would not make a recommendation, until we have done a few other queries. I would add a query for how often it rain's in OAHU, as that can largely effect turnout to our shop. I would also look into the times of day in which it rained, as it could also have a larger or smaller effect, based on when customers normally go visit the beach shops.
